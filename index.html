        <p>It is interesting to me that pretty much everything we create is part of the window object. I was surprised when the author used the example of grabbing a global variable using
            window.variable. Things like window.alert make more sense now. It is also sad that people have abused things like alerts. If they hadn't, they might be more reliable and
            there wouldn't be any danger of the user blocking them.
            It is also interesting to see how much data you can get by using the window object, including a user's current browsing history.

            Workers seem interesting, but what happens to them if the browser crashes, or the user leaves the site before they are done? Do they stop, or do they keep going until they hit an error?
            Websockets make things like chats possible through push messaging.
