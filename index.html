        <p>While a lot of those function features seem really neat, such as
            creating functions that rewrite themselves, it seems awfully complex to
            do things this way. I have trouble thinking of a good use case for a couple of
            things in chapter 11. I am also unsure what makes a promise different from a callback, and why it is so superior.

            If I understand AJAX, it allows the fetching of data without reloading the page.
            This must be extremely handy for creating or updating things on a website.
